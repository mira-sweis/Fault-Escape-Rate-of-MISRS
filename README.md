# Fault-Escape-Rate-of-MISRS
The following program was a project done for my Testing & Reliability of Digital Systems course. It's main functionality is simulating a faulty circuit with inputs generated from an LFSR, and outputs observed by a MISR output compressor. Then compared with a non-faulty simulation for testing the reliability of a MISR with fault detection.
